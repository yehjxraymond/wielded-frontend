# Crafting Actionable Meeting Follow-Ups for Startup Founders - A ChatGPT Tutorial

As a startup founder, ensuring that post-meeting momentum and clarity isn't lost is crucial. Learn how to distill meeting transcripts into concise, actionable follow-ups. With ChatGPT's assistance, transform discussions into SMART tasks, clear delegations, and prioritized action—all integral to your startup's progress. Moreover, explore how Wielded can further streamline this process for you and your team.

In a startup, efficient communication is the bedrock of rapid development and agile response to evolving challenges. You're tasked with ensuring that every meeting leads to action, but sifting through the transcript can be daunting. This is where Wielded and ChatGPT come together to make your role easier, ensuring the right things get done by the right people at the right time.

## The Challenge

Following a meeting, startup founders often struggle with creating a clear, direct path from discussion to execution. The challenge lies in concisely summarizing outcomes, delineating responsibilities, and setting deadlines—all while keeping the team aligned and motivated.

## How to Compose Actionable Follow-Ups from Meeting Transcripts

Converting lengthy meeting transcripts into effective follow-up actions involves:

1. **Extracting Key Points**: Identify the most critical decisions and discussion outcomes.
2. **Designing SMART Action Items**: Craft tasks that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.
3. **Assigning Responsibility**: Clearly state who is in charge of each point.
4. **Prioritizing Urgency**: Ensure that the most vital items are set to be completed first.
5. **Setting Deadlines**: Assign realistic deadlines to maintain momentum and track progress.

## ChatGPT Prompt for Startup Founders to Compose Follow-Ups

```plaintext
Assist me in writing a follow-up email for a meeting we had today, using the provided transcript as a basis. Identify the main topics discussed, decisions made, and any action items agreed upon. These action items should be framed following the SMART criteria and assigned to specific team members with clear deadlines. Prioritize the list so that the most urgent tasks are at the top. The summary should be brief, no more than 300 words, and it should conclude with a call to action, encouraging team members to confirm their tasks or ask for clarification if needed.

Use Markdown to present the follow-up email draft with the following structure:

1. Greeting - A polite and personalized opening to address the team.
2. Meeting Summary - Succinct overview of the meeting's purpose and outcomes.
3. Action Items - A prioritized list of SMART action items with responsible parties and deadlines.
4. Closing - A proactive call to action and sign-off inviting confirmation or questions.

Your final output should look something like this:

<email>
Hello Team,

Thank you for attending today's meeting. Here's a brief summary and the next steps we need to take.

**Meeting Summary:**
_We discussed [Main Topics] and have decided to [Decisions Made]._
