# Mastering Custom Prompts for Precision-Tuned ChatGPT Outputs

Streamlining communication with AI assistants like ChatGPT can dramatically enhance your productivity and ensure the outputs you receive are not just adequate, but exceptional.

Tailoring prompts to your task is both an art and a science. But fear not, for we shall navigate these waters together.

Let's delve into a step-by-step approach for writing custom instructions that can fine-tune ChatGPT's outputs to near perfection.

### Step 1: Identify Best Strategies and Frameworks

Determining the right approach to your instructions can mean the difference between success and a near-miss. Here are some insightful strategies:

- **SMART Goals Framework**: Shape your prompts to be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound for outputs that hit the mark every time.
- **5 W's (and How)**: Incorporate the Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How for detail-rich contexts.
- **User Stories/Use Cases**: Describe your task like a narrative, outlining clear objectives and roles.
- **Iterative Feedback Loop**: Request intermediate feedback within your prompts, fostering a refine-as-you-go approach.
- **Behaviour-Driven Development Syntax**: Embrace the Given-When-Then syntax for clear, action-oriented tasks.

Choose and combine these frameworks to empower ChatGPT to produce the customized content that suits your business needs, like writing engaging blog posts or developing a sales strategy.

### Step 2: Provide a Layout for Information Presentation

Organize your prompt structure for maximum clarity:

- **Task**: Begin with a clear task descriptor.
- **Context/Background**: Offer the necessary particulars about your startup or task at hand.
- **Task Instructions**: Itemize steps with bullet points or numbers.
- **Tone and Style Guidelines**: Specify the writing style and voice desired.
- **Word Count or Time Constraint**: Set realistic limits for the AI's output.
- **Examples or Templates**: To ensure quality, provide examples or templates.
- **Iteration Instructions**: Incorporate steps for iterative feedback or improvements.

### Example: Crafting a Custom Instruction for Writing Medium Blogs

Let's use our template to create an example prompt designed for writing a Medium blog post:

```

**Task:**
Write an Engaging Medium Blog Post on AI-influenced Productivity in Startups

**Context:**
The article is for a startup-focused blog, emphasizing how AI tools, like ChatGPT or our bespoke AI productivity platform, Wielded, can revolutionize workflow efficiencies. Unique selling point of Wielded:
1. Ability to build custom "persona" in the app to allow user to switch context quickly yet allowing the tool to have full context of what they are doing. For instance, a marketer could be working on SEO keyword research and switch to LinkedIn post creation quickly. The persona not only helps to retain context of the problem space but also preferences like output formats, style of writing, etc.
2. Easy deployment allowing team leaders to get GPT-4 in the hands of all the team members to boost productivity
3. Team billing that simplify the claims process for organisations


**Template**:
1. Start with an intriguing hook
2. Introduction of problem
3. Agitate the problem
4. Solve the problem with suggested solution
5. Provide an example of a problem solved with the solution

**Tone and Style Guidelines**:
The post should be informative, personable, and conversational to resonate with tech-savvy entrepreneurs. Weave in our innovative approach subtly.

**Word Count or Time Constraint**:
Aim for 750-1000 words.

### Combining Custom Instructions with Personalized "Persona" Prompts in Wielded

Custom instructions are powerful, yet when coupled with Wielded's "persona" feature, they become transformative. A "persona" in Wielded encapsulates not just a task's context and specifics, but also the preferred tone, style, and output format, enabling you to switch between tasks with unprecedented speed and seamlessness.

Creating a persona is akin to giving ChatGPT a role in a play, complete with a character background, motivation, and script. This role enables the AI to maintain a consistent tone and understanding of tasks related to that persona. For example, when switching from SEO keyword research to LinkedIn content crafting, you don't need to reset the context fully—just switch the persona, and ChatGPT adapts to the new task under the same coherent identity.

#### Here's How to Integrate Persona with Custom Instructions in Wielded:

1. **Name Your Persona**: Assign a distinctive name to each persona that reflects its role or function, like "SEO Maven" or "Content Curator".

2. **Label for Distinction**: Give each persona a clear label that helps you to easily identify and select it for the corresponding tasks.

3. **Craft Persona Instructions**: For each persona, input instructions that provide both the background context and detailed steps on how to carry out the specific task.

4. **Save the Persona**: Once your persona is named, labeled, and has its instructions set, save it within Wielded for future use.

5. **Engage with the Persona**: When you start a new chat, simply invoke the persona you need, and the AI will apply all the related context and instructions, enabling you to jump straight into action.

By using personas, you effectively create shortcuts for your workflow. They allow you to bypass repetitive briefing and steer right into productive dialogue with ChatGPT, significantly saving time and enhancing efficiency. The persona becomes your AI-powered specialist, always ready, never needing a recap.
