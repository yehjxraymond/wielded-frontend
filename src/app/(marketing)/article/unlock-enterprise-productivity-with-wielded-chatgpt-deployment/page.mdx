## Deploying ChatGPT Across Your Organization: Unlock Enterprise Productivity with Wielded

In today's fast-paced digital environment, **Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the way teams work**. 

**ChatGPT**, in particular, has emerged as a game-changer for boosting productivity within organizations. However, there's a palpable challenge when it comes to deploying ChatGPT effectively and affordably across entire teams. 

Existing options like individual accounts or enterprise subscriptions come with their own set of hurdles, such as high costs or unsuitability for smaller teams. This is where [Wielded](https://wielded.com) addresses a critical need, providing a seamless, cost-effective alternative that channels the power of GPT-4 into the hands of every team member at a fraction of the cost.

### The Challenge with Current ChatGPT Enterprise Solutions

The usual routes for incorporating ChatGPT into businesses are far from ideal. For instance, individual ChatGPT accounts can accumulate a hefty tab of $20 per user each month, creating cumbersome claims processes due to separate subscriptions. On the other hand, an enterprise subscription often requires a custom quote from OpenAI, which isn't designed for teams with fewer than 200 members.

Both arrangements prove to be steepâ€”both in terms of cost and administrative overhead. Here, we intersect the pain points:

- **AI for Enterprise:** Priced out of reach for small to mid-sized teams.
- **ChatGPT Enterprise Pricing:** High costs that scale with team size.
- **ChatGPT for Teams:** A lack of flexible, scalable solutions for different team sizes.

### The Wielded Advantage

Wielded arrives as a disruptor in the market, specifically designed for dynamic teams needing **an affordable and scalable AI tool**.
